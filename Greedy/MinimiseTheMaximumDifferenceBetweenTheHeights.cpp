Problem:-Given an array of integers A representing heights of towers and a positive integer B.
It is allowed to either increase or decrease the height of every tower by B (only once).

Find and return the minimum possible difference between the heights of the longest
and the shortest tower after modifications.

Note: It is mandatory to either increase or decrease the height of every tower.

Input 1:
    A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    B = 2
Output 1:
    3

Input 2:
    A = [5, 17, 100, 11]
    B = 10
Output 2:
    75
